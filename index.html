        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Melissa! I just moved to WA from NC with my boyfriend and our three pups. I used to work in the
          health and fitness field as a health coach and fitness instructor until landing my supposed "dream job" as a
          paralegal for a small law firm. It was everything I thought I wanted in a job: a great boss, fully remote,
          flexible hours, and unlimited PTO. Two years later, I realized how wrong I had been. I was bored, restless,
          and looking for a challenge. It was time for a change.
        </p>
        <p>In my free time, I love to be out in nature. Nothing makes me feel more at peace. I love to hike and run but
          mostly I just enjoy long peaceful walks in the middle of nowhere, preferably near a large body of water. My
          greatest passions in life are psychology and philosophy. I could talk about them for hours! I love reading,
          listening to podcasts, and of course, binge watching new shows on Netflix. </p>
